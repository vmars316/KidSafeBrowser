# KidSafeBrowser
Open Source 'Kid Safe Browser' Starting from Holkein WebView Browser .
vmars316 I am starting with Hokein's Webview Browser .
To develop this into a openSource 'kid safe browser' .
First thing is to read in a "SafeSites.txt" file .

I started programming at age 26 in 1969 
with IBM mainfram 360/30 , using Cobol , BAL , and RPG . 
A few months ago , I strted writting my KidSfeBrowser (for my GrandKids) in PureBasic . But soon learned of its grave limitations , a Procedural Language like all the above . 
So I restarted in VS2019 (learning vb.net & .vb) , And completed Browser . But turns out it uses only IE11 , which turns out many websites can't handle . 
So tried WebView , but also a NOGO .
So I switched to WebView2 and sarted learnng C# . And I got to the part where it can't doesn't yet handle HtmlDOM . So I am trying the InjectJavascript business , still a backBurner WIP .
